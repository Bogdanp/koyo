@defmodule[koyo/database]

This module provides a database component and functionality for
working with database connections.

@defproc[(database? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] when @racket[v] is a database component.
}

@defproc[(make-database-factory [connector (-> connection?)]
                                [#:max-connections max-connections exact-positive-integer? 16]
                                [#:max-idle-connections max-idle-connections exact-positive-integer? 2]) (-> database?)]{

  Returns a function that will create a database component containing
  a DB connection pool of size @racket[#:max-connections] which
  connects to the database using the @racket[connector].

  @history[#:changed "0.8" @elem{The component no longer forcefully
  shuts down its associated custodian when the component is
  stopped. There is now a lower bound on @tt{crypto-lib} for version
  1.6 to ensure that shared libraries (eg. for libargon2) correctly
  get included in distributions (using @tt{koyo dist} or @tt{raco
  distribute}).}]
}

@defproc[(call-with-database-connection [database database?]
                                        [proc (-> connection? any)]) any]{

  Retrieves a database connection from the pool and passes it to
  @racket[proc].  Once @racket[proc] completes, the connection is
  returned to the pool.

  Nested calls to @racket[call-with-database-connection] reuse the
  same connection.
}

@defproc[(call-with-database-transaction [database database?]

  Retrieves a database connection from the pool, enters a transaction
  with the requested @racket[#:isolation] level and passes the
  connection to @racket[proc].  If @racket[proc] completes
  successfully, the transaction is committed, otherwise it is rolled
  back.

  Nested calls to @racket[call-with-database-transaction] reuse the
  same connection and, if the database supports it, create nested
  transactions.

  These forms are syntactic sugar for calling @racket[call-with-database-connection]
  and @racket[call-with-database-transaction], respectively, with an
  anonymous thunk.

  For example, the following forms are equivalent:

  @racketblock[
    (with-database-connection [c the-db]
      (query-value c "select 42"))
  ]

  @racketblock[
    (call-with-database-connection the-db
      (lambda (c)
        (query-value c "select 42")))
  ]

}
