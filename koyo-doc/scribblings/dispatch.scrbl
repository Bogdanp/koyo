@defmodule[koyo/dispatch]

This module provides syntax for building a role-aware dispatch
procedure and dispatcher combinators.

  A variant of @racket[dispatch-rules] where each
  @racket[dispatch-clause] takes an optional list of roles and an
  optional name.

  Returns three values: a dispatcher procedure as in
  @racket[dispatch-rules], a procedure that can generate reverse URIs
  and a procedure that, given a @racket[request], can return the
  required set of roles for the matching @racket[dispatch-proc].

  Reverse URI generation differs from @racket[dispatch-rules] in that
  the first argument must be a symbol representing the name of the route
  rather than a @racket[dispatch-proc]. This helps avoid deep dependency
  chains between routes. The name for a route is either the value passed
  to @racket[maybe-name] or the name of its dispatch procedure.
}

@defproc[(dispatch/mount [root string?]
                         [dispatcher dispatcher/c]) dispatcher/c]{

  Returns a new dispatcher that reroots incoming requests using
  @racket[request-reroot] with the given @racket[root] before passing
  the result to @racket[dispatcher]. Calls @racket[next-dispatcher] when
  a request cannot be rerooted.

  The rerooted dispatcher is parameterized to cooperate with the
  @racket[reverse-uri] procedure, meaning that generating a reverse URL
  from within a request handler called by the dispatcher results in a
  URL with the @racket[root] prepended to it.

  Combine @racket[dispatch-rules+roles], @racket[dispatch/servlet] and
  @racket[dispatch/mount] to embed modular sub-applications into larger
  applications where the former have no knowledge of the URL structure
  of the larger application.
